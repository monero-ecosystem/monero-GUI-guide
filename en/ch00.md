## Windows Preparation
If you are on Windows:

+ Make sure that your antivirus does not block the program.

A miner is included in the Monero GUI software and, as a result, most anti virus software flags the Monero GUI files as malware and subsequently quarantines them. Fortunately, however, there's a fairly trivial work around you can use. That is:

+ Create a new directory / folder.
+ Open your AV software.
+ Add an exception for the newly created directory / folder. Put differently, you have to whitelist the newly created directory / folder.
+ Extract the .zip file (in case of Windows) or the .tar.bz2 file (in case of Linux or Mac OS X) to the whitelisted directory / folder.
  
  *Note:* if you're using Windows and did not install custom anti virus software, Windows Defender is, most likely, acting as active anti virus software.

+ The first time you start the wallet you must give permission to connect to the network via a pop-up. Check the appropriate boxes and click `Allow access`.
