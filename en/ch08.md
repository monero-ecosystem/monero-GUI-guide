# About remote nodes
Remote nodes can be very useful if you are not able/don't want to download the whole blockchain, but be advised that malicious remote nodes could compromise the level of privacy of your transaction, tracking your IP or, in extreme cases, even showing the amount transacted. That said, a list of remote nodes can be found at [moneroworld.com](https://moneroworld.com). Keep in mind anybody is able to add a node to that list, you shouldn't consider those nodes as trusted or safe, always run your own node for the best privacy.

## Bootstrap nodes
A bootstrap node is a remote node to use whilst also syncing the blockchain. This is different to a straight up remote node in that using a remote node will not also sync the blockchain to local.    
If the bootstrap node feature is utilized it will always automatically switch to the local node when the blockchain is fully synced, regardless of whether the user put in the remote node themselves or the remote node was specified by default.
