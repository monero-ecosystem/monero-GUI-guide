# Create a Wallet
![welcome](media/wizard_2-options.png)

On this page you can choose how to connect to the wallet and to the network:

(1) **Create a new wallet:** Start the procedure to make a new wallet. Choose this option if this is your first time using Monero.  
(2) **Create new wallet from hardware:** Create a new wallet from an hardware device (like Ledger or Trezor)  
(3) **Open a wallet from file:** Choose this option to select a pre-existing wallet from your files with the extension `.keys`.  
(4) **Restore wallet from keys or mnemonic seed:** Click here if you want to recover a pre-existing wallet using the mnemonic seed or the keys.  
(5) **Change wallet mode:**  Click here to switch between modes and choose the wallet mode that best fits your needs.  
(6) **Mainnet:** *Advanced:* Select this from the dropdown list to use the main Monero network  
(7) **Testnet:** *Advanced:* Select this from the dropdown list if you would like to use a development network instead of the main network. Testnet is designed to let developers test new features that are not available on Mainnet or Stagenet.  
(8) **Stagenet:** *Advanced:* Select this from the dropdown list if you would like to use a network for staging instead of the main network. Stagenet mimics the features of Mainnet and is designed to let end users test Monero without the risk of losing funds.  
(9) **Number of KDF rounds:** *Advanced:* Adjust the number of Key Derivation Function rounds in order to enhance the overall security of the generated keys. Any random large number will increase the security.  

## Create new wallet
![new](media/wizard_3-create.png)

Here you can create a new wallet:

(1) **Wallet name:** Give a name for your wallet (in this example `testname` is used).  
(2) **Mnemonic seed: Write down your [mnemonic seed](https://getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/mnemonicseed.html) and keep it safe. Your seed is the master key of your wallet, you can use it to recover your funds.**  
(3) **Wallet location:** Select the destination folder of the wallet.  

### Add a password
![add password](media/wizard_4-pass.png)

Add a strong password to protect your wallet. If you lose your password, then only your mnemonic seed can recover your wallet.

### Daemon settings (Advanced mode)
![daemon settings](media/wizard_5-daemon-settings.png)

Here you can choose if you are going to run a full node or use a remote one:

(1) **Start node in background:** Check this box to run a full node and begin blockchain sync.  
(2) **Blockchain location (optional):** To store the blockchain somewhere other than default, enter that location here.  
(3) **Bootstrap node:** To use a bootstrap node enter the host and port. A bootstrap node allows you to use your wallet while you are downloading the blockchain by connecting to a remote node. For a list of available remote nodes and info about them, check the [About remote nodes](#about-remote-nodes) section of this guide.  
(4) **Connect to a remote node:** Check this box if you want to use only a remote node without downloading the blockchain. You will need to put the host and port of the remote node after checking the box.

### Run a full node
Upon completion of the setup you will be prompted to the settings menu, but first you will see a window like this pop up:

![sync](media/daemon-launch.png)

If you want to create a normal wallet using your personal full node, you don't need to do anything, let the countdown finish, then wait until your node is fully synced.  
If you need some special settings, like setting up a view-only wallet or adding the blockchain manually, go to [Settings](#settings).  

## Create new wallet from hardware
On this page you can create a new wallet file from your hardware wallet. This wallet will be stored in your computer and every time you open it you will be asked to connect and unlock your hardware wallet. Monero GUI currently supports the hardware wallet models Ledger Nano S/X and Trezor Model T.

### Create the wallet
![2.4.1](media/create_hardware_wallet.png)

(1) **Wallet name:** Give a name for your wallet (in this example `ledger-test` is used).  
(2) **Wallet location:** Select the destination folder of the wallet.   
(3) **Create a new wallet from device:** Select this option if this is the first time you use a hardware wallet.  
(4) **Restore a wallet from device:** Choose this option if you already had a hardware wallet and want to restore it.  
**Creation Date or Restore height (optional):** *Restore only:* If you know the date or block height that your wallet was created at, you can specify it here so the wallet doesn't have to scan the entire blockchain looking for your funds. For example, if your first transaction was included on `2017-07-08` in block `1350000`, you should put the previous day date (e.g. `2017-07-06`) or a slightly lower height (e.g. `1330000`) so the wallet will start scanning from there, saving you some time. More information about restore height on [StackExchange](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/7581/what-is-the-relevance-of-the-restore-height).  
(5) **Subaddress lookahead (optional):** pregenerate a number of accounts with a number of subaddresses each.  
(6) **Device name:** Select the hardware wallet you want to use. Monero is currently supported in Ledger Nano S/X and Trezor Model T.

### Add a password

Add a strong password to protect your wallet. If you forget the password of a wallet created from your hardware wallet, you will be able to create another wallet from your hardware device.

## Restore wallet from keys or mnemonic seed

### Restoring from seed
![restore from seed](media/wizard_6-restore-seed.png)

Restoring from your mnemonic seed is the easiest way to recover your wallet. You need to put the following information:

(1) **Wallet name:** Give a name for your wallet (in this example `testname` is used).  
(2) **Mnemonic seed:** Paste your seed made of 25 (or 24) words.  
(3) **Creation Date or Restore height (optional):** If you know the date or block height that your wallet was created at, you can specify it here so the wallet doesn't have to scan the entire blockchain looking for your funds. For example, if your first transaction was included on `2017-07-08` in block `1350000`, you should put the previous day date (e.g. `2017-07-06`) or a slightly lower height (e.g. `1330000`) so the wallet will start scanning from there, saving you some time. More information about restore height on [StackExchange](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/7581/what-is-the-relevance-of-the-restore-height).  
(4) **Wallet location:** Select the destination folder of the wallet.  

A detailed guide is available on getmonero.org: ['How to restore your account'](https://getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/restore_account.html)

### Restoring from keys
![restore from key](media/wizard_7-restore-keys.png)

Restoring from keys is quite easy and can be extremely useful, especially if you are moving your wallet from an online service like MyMonero. You need to put the following information:

(1) **Wallet name:** Give a name for your wallet (in this example `testname` is used).  
(2) **Account address:** The address of the wallet you are recovering.  
(3) **View key:** Your private view key (needed to be able to check your funds).  
(4) **Spend key:** Your private spend key (needed to spend your funds).  
(5) **Creation Date or Restore height (optional):** If you know the date or block height that your wallet was created at, you can specify it here so the wallet doesn't have to scan the entire blockchain looking for your funds. For example, if your first transaction was included on `2017-07-08` in block `1350000`, you should put the previous day date (e.g. `2017-07-06`) or a slightly lower height (e.g. `1330000`) so the wallet will start scanning from there, saving you some time. More information about restore height on [StackExchange](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/7581/what-is-the-relevance-of-the-restore-height).  
(6) **Wallet location:** Select the destination folder of the wallet.  

When everything is ready click the right arrow and then the `Use Monero` button.  
A detailed guide is available on getmonero.org: ['Restoring wallet from keys'](https://getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/restore_from_keys.html)

## Open a wallet from file
After clicking this option a window will pop up. Navigate to your file with the extension `.keys`, select it and click the right arrow.
