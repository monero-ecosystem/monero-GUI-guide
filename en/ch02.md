# Create a Wallet
![welcome](media/wizard_2-options.png)

On this page you can choose between three methods for accessing a wallet, and two options for connecting to the network:

(1) **Create a new wallet:** Start the procedure to make a new wallet. Choose this option if this is your first time using Monero.    
(2) **Restore wallet from keys or mnemonic seed:** Click here if you want to recover a pre-existing wallet using the mnemonic seed or the keys.    
(3) **Open a wallet from file:** Choose this option to select a pre-existing wallet from your files with the extension `.keys`.    
(4) **Create new wallet from hardware:** Create a new wallet from an hardware device (like Ledger)    
(5) **Mainnet:** *Advanced:* use the main Monero network    
(6) **Testnet:** *Advanced:* Check this box if you would like to use a development network instead of the main network. Testnet is designed to let developers test new features that are not available on Mainnet or Stagenet.    
(7) **Stagenet:** *Advanced:* Check this box if you would like to use a network for staging instead of the main network. Stagenet mimics the features of Mainnet and is designed to let end users test Monero without the risk of losing funds.    

## Create new wallet
![new](media/wizard_3-create.png)

Here you can create a new wallet:

(1) **Wallet name:** Give a name for your wallet (in this example `testname` is used).    
(2) **Mnemonic seed: Write down your [mnemonic seed](https://getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/mnemonicseed.html) and keep it safe. Your seed is the master key of your wallet, you can use it to recover your funds.**    
(3) **Wallet location:** Select the destination folder of the wallet.    

### Add a password
![add password](media/wizard_4-pass.png)

Add a strong password to protect your wallet. If you lose your password, then only your mnemonic seed can recover your wallet.

### Daemon settings
![daemon settings](media/wizard_5-daemon-settings.png)

Here you can choose if you are going to run a full node or use a remote one:

(1) **Start node in background:** Check this box to run a full node and begin blockchain sync.    
(2) **Blockchain location (optional):** To store the blockchain somewhere other than default, enter that location here.    
(3) **Bootstrap node:** To use a bootstrap node enter the host and port. A bootstrap node allows you to use your wallet while you are downloading the blockchain by connecting to a remote node. For a list of available remote nodes and info about them, check the [About remote nodes](#8-about-remote-nodes) section of this guide.    
(4) **Connect to a remote node:** Check this box if you want to use only a remote node without downloading the blockchain. You will need to put the host and port of the remote node after checking the box.

### Run a full node
Upon completion of the setup you will be prompted to the settings menu, but first you will see a window like this pop up:

![sync](media/daemon-launch.png)

If you want to create a normal wallet using your personal full node, you don't need to do anything, let the countdown finish, then wait until your node is fully synced.

If you need some special settings, like setting up a view-only wallet or adding the blockchain manually, go to [section 3](#3-settings).    


## Restore wallet from keys or mnemonic seed


### Restoring from seed
![restore from seed](media/wizard_6-restore-seed.png)

Restoring from your mnemonic seed is the easiest way to recover your wallet. You need to put the following information:

(1) **Wallet name:** Give a name for your wallet (in this example `testname` is used).    
(2) **Mnemonic seed:** Paste your seed made of 25 (or 24) words.    
(3) **Restore height (optional):** If you know the block height that your wallet was created at, you can specify it here so the wallet doesn't have to scan the entire blockchain looking for your funds. For example, if your first transaction was included in block `1350000`, you should put a slightly lower height (e.g. `1330000`) so the wallet will start scanning from there, saving you some time.    
(4) **Wallet location:** Select the destination folder of the wallet.    

A detailed guide is available on getmonero.org: ['How to restore your account'](https://getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/restore_account.html)

### Restoring from keys
![restore from key](media/wizard_7-restore-keys.png)

Restoring from keys is quite easy and can be extremely useful, especially if you are moving your wallet from an online service like MyMonero. You need to put the following information:

(1) **Wallet name:** Give a name for your wallet (in this example `testname` is used).    
(2) **Account address:** The address of the wallet you are recovering.    
(3) **View key:** Your private view key (needed to be able to check your funds).    
(4) **Spend key:** Your private spend key (needed to spend your funds).    
(5) **Restore height (optional):** If you know the block height that your wallet was created at, you can specify it here so the wallet doesn't have to scan the entire blockchain looking for your funds. For example, if your first transaction was included in block `1350000`, you should put a slightly lower height (e.g. `1330000`) so the wallet will start scanning from there, saving you some time.    
(6) **Wallet location:** Select the destination folder of the wallet.    

When everything is ready click the right arrow and then the `Use Monero` button.    
A detailed guide is available on getmonero.org: ['Restoring wallet from keys'](https://getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/restore_from_keys.html)

## Open a wallet from file
After clicking this option a window will pop up. Navigate to your file with the extension `.keys`, select it and click the right arrow.

## Create new wallet from hardware

### Create the wallet
![2.4.1](media/create_hardware_wallet.png)

(1) **Wallet name:** Give a name for your wallet (in this example `ledger-test` is used).    
(2) **Restore Height (optional):** If you know the block height that your wallet was created at, you can specify it here so the wallet doesn't have to scan the entire blockchain looking for your funds. For example, if your first transaction was included in block `1350000`, you should put a slightly lower height (e.g. `1330000`) so the wallet will start scanning from there, saving you some time.    
(3) **Subaddress lookahead (optional):** pregenerate a number of accounts with a number of subaddresses each    
(4) **Device name:** Select the hardware wallet you want to use (at the moment, only 'Ledger' is available)    
(5) **Wallet location:** Select the destination folder of the wallet.
