# Receive Monero
![receive](../media/black_receive.png)

The `Receive` tab provides tools for generating subaddresses.

(1) **Addresses:** This list includes your wallet's primary address (starting with 4...) and all its subaddresses (starting with 8...).  
(2) **Create new address:** This button allows you to create as many new subaddresses as you wish. Since Monero is private, you don't need to create a new subaddress every time you receive a transaction. However, to avoid off-chain linking, it's recommended that you create a new subaddress for every person, company or exchange you will receive Monero from. *Learn more about [subaddresses](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/3673/what-is-a-sub-address).*  
(3) **Set Label:** Click on this button to set this subaddress label. You can use this label to store the person, company or exchange you gave this subaddress.  
(4) **QR code:** This is a QR code that has your selected address embedded into it. It can be used as a way to give others your Monero address by scanning the code.  
(5) **Save:** Click here to save the QR code as a `png` image.  
(6) **Copy:** Click here to copy the QR code corresponding URL formated as *monero:<address>*  

## Merchant mode
![merchant](../media/merchant.png)

The `Merchant` mode offers vendors a simple Point of Sale (PoS) to receive Monero (XMR). It allows you to manually generate payment requests, and to monitor incoming transactions (unconfirmed and confirmed transactions). 

(1) **QR code:** This is a QR code that contains your currently selected address, and, optionally, the amount to receive. Display this QR code to your customers, so they can scan it and pay using their mobile wallets.  
(2) **Amount to receive (XMR):** This is used to create a payment request. Enter the amount of Monero (XMR) you would like to receive, and the QR code will be updated.  
(3) **Payment URL:** This is the URL corresponding to the address and amount you have chosen. It could be copied by clicking on it and sent to a customer.  
(4) **Enable sales tracker:** If you tick this box, you'll see a list of incoming transactions. By enabling sales tracker, the merchant page will automatically scan the blockchain and the tx pool for incoming transactions using the QR code. It's up to you whether to accept unconfirmed transactions or not. It is likely they'll be confirmed in short order, but there is still a possibility they might not, so for larger values you may want to wait for one or more confirmation(s).  
(5) **Sales:** Those are the transactions currently seen on the blockchain and the transaction pool, with associated confirmations.
