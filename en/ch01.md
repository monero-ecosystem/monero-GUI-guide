## Choose wallet mode
![mode](media/wizard_1_1-mode.png)

This page lets you choose the mode that best suits your accessibility and privacy needs.  
*Note:* Stagenet and Testnnet only supports *Advanced mode*.

(1) **Simple mode:** In this mode your wallet will display a simple interface with easy access to basic functionality like sending, receiving, transactions history, address book, accounts, and merchant mode, as well as hardware wallet support. It will connect to a third-party server (a remote node), and it will not start a local node in your computer (the blockchain will not be downloaded). Choose this option if you don't have enough space to store the blockchain file (at least 90 GB), if you don't require maximum privacy and you accept the privacy risks of using a remote node to connect to the Monero network.  
(2) **Simple mode (bootstrap):** In this mode your wallet will also display a simple interface with easy access to basic functionality. Additionaly it will start a local node in the background. This local node will start the download of the blockchain file (at least 90 GB), which can take many hours or even days. While the blockchain file is being downloaded, your local node will temporarily connect to a third-party server (a remote node known as bootstrap node), which will allow you to start using Monero immediately. After downloading and synchronizing the blockchain and the wallet, your local node will only temporarily connect to the bootstrap node when your blockchain is not updated. Be aware that using a remote node (including a bootstrap node) to connect to the Monero network may reduce your privacy.  
(3) **Advanced mode:** In this mode your wallet will display all advanced features available, like changing fees/transaction priority, solo mining, message verification, transaction proof/check, offline transaction signing, key images importing, custom remote node (including .onion remote nodes), custom bootstrap node, starting a local node without setting a bootstrap node (maximum privacy), changing blockchain location, and daemon log. In this mode you can choose if you want to connect to the Monero network via a remote node or a local node. If you decide to run a local node, the blockchain file will be downloaded. If you want to start using Monero immediately, you can also set a bootstrap node (remote node) in the Settings > Node page. To achieve maximum privacy in your connection to the Monero network, it's recommended to avoid using a remote/bootstrap node and instead use advanced mode to start a local node without setting a bootstrap node.  
(4) **Change language:** This will let you choose the language from the startup page (again).

## About the Simple/Bootstrap mode
![acknowledgement](media/wizard_1_2-warning.png)

Upon choosing simple mode or bootstrap mode, an acknowledgement page will be shown, explaining the features, behavior, and privacy constraints of the mode.  
Please carefully read those informations before accepting the implications of this mode and proceed to the next step.  
You must understand the inherent risks of using a remote node for your privacy, and you should avoid using it with large amounts of money. If you connect to a *malicious* remote node, it could track your IP address, your "restore height" and associated block request data, and send you inaccurate information to learn more about transactions you make.

(1) **Region:** Choose a region to pick up the remote nodes from. The closer the node is, the better the wallet performance will be.  
(2) **Acknowledgement:** Check This box if you have **fully understood** the privacy implications of a remote node and agree to **weaken your privacy** by using it.
