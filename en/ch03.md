# Synchronization
![sync_remotenode](media/sync_remotenode.png)

After creating and opening a wallet file, Monero GUI will start synchronizing. This process is required to know your balance, receive and send transactions.

Monero GUI's synchronization is composed of two parts:
1) Daemon synchronization
2) Wallet synchronization

## Daemon synchronization
Monero GUI wallet uses a daemon (monerod), which is a program running in the background that synchronizes with the Monero network to scan for incoming transactions and to send new transactions.

Your daemon must have access to the Monero blockchain, which is a very large file (more than 100 GB) which contains all transactions that have been made since the beginning of Monero in 2014. The blockchain file can be stored in your computer (if your daemon run a local node) or in a computer of another person (if your daemon connect to a third-party remote node).

### Daemon synchronization with local node
If you use a local node (full node), your wallet daemon will download the blockchain file into your computer. Since it's a very large file (more than 100 GB), this can take a long time, even days, depending on your internet speed.

If you use a local node with a bootstrap node or "simple mode (bootstrap)", your wallet daemon will also download the blockchain file into your computer, but it will connect to a remote node (a bootstrap node) while the download is not finished.

### Daemon synchronization with remote node
If you use a public remote node or "simple mode", your daemon will use the blockchain of a third party remote note. Since it will not have to download the whole blockchain file, your synchronization will be faster.

### Block height
After your daemon and your wallet are synchronized, your daemon progress bar will display "Daemon is synchronized (number)", see below:

This number between parenthesis is the current block height, which is the latest block received by your daemon. In average, this number wil increase +1 every 2 minutes, when a new block is found by a miner.

## Wallet synchronization
After synchronizing the daemon, your wallet will scan the blockchain file with its private view key, searching for past transactions. Once a previous transaction is detected and retrieved by your wallet, your balance and your transaction history will be updated.

Since all transactions are encrypted in Monero, your wallet will have to decrypt a lot of transactions. This process places very high demands on your computer's resources, including CPU processing and many readings and writings in your hard disk. Depending on your system configuration, this can take a long time, even days, so please be patient. Be aware that the synchronization speed is not always constant. Some blocks can have more transactions and/or use different technologies, therefore they may take longer to verify.

### Wallet restore height
The wallet restore height is the block number (block height) where your wallet will start searching for transactions.
This number should be a block height before the block that included your first incoming transaction.
For example, if your wallet received Monero for the first time in 2020-09-20, your wallet restore height must be a block number before the block height of this date. Monero wallets usually ask you to write down your wallet restore height together with your restore seed when you are creating a wallet.

### How to change Wallet restore height / Wrong or zero balance after synchronizing
In order to see the correct balance, your wallet must be fully synchronized AND using a correct restore height.
If your wallet is fully synchronized but your balance is still wrong, you're probably using a wallet restore height that is higher than the block height of your first incoming transaction.
To solve this, you have to set a new wallet restore height. Go to Settings > Info page, Wallet restore height and click on "(Change)".

Next, enter a new restore height or an estimate date before your first incoming transaction, and then click on "Ok".

Your wallet will now rescan the blockchain starting from the new restore height.

### How to speed up wallet initial synchronization
Some factors that can increase the speed of your initial synchronization are:
* Broadband internet connection
* Using a SSD (solid state disk drive) instead of an HDD (hard disk drive)
* Having a faster CPU
* Connecting to a remote node will avoid downloading the blockchain.
